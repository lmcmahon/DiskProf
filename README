# DiskProf

This is a simple program to display a visual representation
of where your hard drive space is being used. The GUI is kind
of a hack, but it works. It consists of a series of buttons
labeled with the names of directories, where each button's size is
proportional to the directory's size. Click a button to expand that
folder and see it's subdirectories.

## Usage

You can create a runnable jar file using leiningen.
